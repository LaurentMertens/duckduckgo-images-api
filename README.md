# DuckDuckGo Image Search API
Tested with Python 2.7

Simple source code.

First request pulls a much needed token,
From 2nd request, we pull search results for FREE !!
We have some basic logic, to retry the search engine in case it doesn't reply us with results.

If you would like to contribute changes, Feel free to do so !
